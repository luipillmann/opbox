# OpBox
This project contains the first version for the development of OpBox software.

## About
OpBox aims to be a an easy to use and modular system, allowing researchers to upgrade existing Skinner boxes, as well as building them from scratch. It's entirely self contained, meaning it's independent from any external equipment for processing or storage. In order to make OpBox as accessible as possible and foster future development, everything is open source hardware and software.

## Implementation
OpBox is implemented with off-the-shelf components. It uses a Raspberry Pi 2 as its main processor and an Arduino Uno to interface with sensors and actuators. The code presented here is divided into `/raspi` with Python scripts for the RPi and `/arduino` with the sketches.
